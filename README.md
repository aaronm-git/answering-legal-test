## Project Information

### Project Assignment - Frontend Technical Challenge

We would like you to complete a small project to evaluate your frontend development skills. Please read the following instructions carefully:

#### Requirements

1. **Stack to Use**

   - Next.js
   - TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS

2. **Design**

   - You will receive a Figma design file that you should implement as closely as possible.
   - The Figma file will also include a link to a Google Drive folder with the images you will need for the design.
   - Please pay attention to layout, responsiveness, and design details.

3. **Functionality**

   - Implement the page from the design.
   - Include a form (as shown in the design).
     - The form does **not** need to be connected to a backend.
     - On submission, show some kind of confirmation state (e.g., a success message or an alert).
     - Handle basic validation and error states (e.g., required fields, invalid email).

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the project on Vercel.

#### Evaluation Criteria

We will evaluate based on:

- Code quality (clean, modular, well-structured).
- Responsiveness and design fidelity (matches the Figma design).
- Use of TypeScript (types/interfaces, proper typing).
- Form handling (validation, error states, submission feedback).
- Attention to detail (small UI/UX touches).

#### Delivery

- Please send us:
  - The Vercel deployment link.
  - The GitHub repository link with your code.
- Send both links by email to nick@answeringlegal.com and giseller@answeringlegal.com.
